## Summary of New Requirements (REQ-0020 through REQ-0024)

### REQ-0020: Speaking Duration Tracking in Firebase
- Track `slotStartedAt` when speaker is selected
- Calculate actual speaking duration when slot ends
- Store in `speakingHistory` array with `startTime`, `endTime`, `durationSeconds`
- Accumulate `totalSpokeDurationSeconds` per participant (never resets)
- Implementation: Modify `lib/session.ts` end-slot logic and update Firebase schema

### REQ-0021: Timer Over-Time Display Format
- Extend Timer.tsx to display over-time as `+M:SS` (e.g., `+1:12`)
- Switch format when `slotEndsAt < Date.now()`
- Apply distinct visual state (red background) different from expired indicator
- Update useTimer.ts to compute both countdown and over-time
- Modify Timer color states to include new over-time state

### REQ-0022: Host Participates in Speaker Rotation
- Update SpeakerSelector.tsx logic to allow host selection (remove host from ineligibility check)
- Host can select themselves as first speaker
- Host appears in eligible next-speaker list if they haven't spoken in current round
- Update speaker selection validation to include host in rotation

### REQ-0023: Meeting Summary with Speaking Times
- Create new MeetingSummary.tsx component
- Display when `status: 'finished'` or when End Meeting is confirmed
- Show: Name, Total Time Spoken, Over-time Flag (if exceeded slotDurationSeconds), Number of Turns
- Highlight rows red if participant exceeded their slot duration in any turn
- Allow host to close summary or return to active meeting view

### REQ-0024: End Meeting Warning for Unspoken Users
- Create EndMeetingDialog.tsx confirmation modal
- Trigger when host clicks End Meeting with unspoken participants
- Dialog: "X participant(s) haven't spoken yet. End meeting anyway?" with [Cancel] [End Meeting] buttons
- Calculate unspoken: `participants not in spokenUserIds`
- Make "End Meeting" button always enabled (remove speaker-active disabled state)

### REQ-0028: Meeting Layout - Participant List in Main Column
- Remove the right-side aside layout on large screens
- Stack the participant list above the timer for all breakpoints
- Maintain existing spacing and card styles

### REQ-0029: Remove Active Speaker Panel
- Remove ActiveSpeaker component usage from the meeting view
- Rely on the participant list "Speaking" badge only
- Ensure empty-speaker state is handled without the panel

### REQ-0030: Participant Row Total Time Badge
- Show total speaking time in each participant row
- Display format: "Total: M:SS"
- Place as a right-aligned badge next to status chips
- Do not show overtime styling in the participant list

### REQ-0031: Single-Turn Session Flow
- Do not reset `spokenUserIds` when all participants have spoken
- Prevent next-speaker selection once everyone has spoken
- Hide the SpeakerSelector when no eligible participants remain
- Keep end-slot behavior limited to the active speaker

### REQ-0032: Meeting Summary Overtime Styling Update
- Keep overtime indicator in Meeting Summary only
- Remove red highlight styling for overtime rows
- Keep total time display unchanged
