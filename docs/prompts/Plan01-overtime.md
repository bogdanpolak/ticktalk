# New requirements.

1. I need a new requirement(s) to count time exceeded in the timer, eg. over 1:12.
2. I the summary of the Meeting page *when user clicks [End Meeting] I want to add to the list of participants total time which tey spoke. Over time should be highlighted.
3. Host should have the same view for the `Select Next Speaker` section. Host can select itself to be a fist speaker. When someone else is speaking Host should see the same section `Participants` as normal user. The only special thing that host can do during speaking session is to End Meeting.
4. End Meeting should be active always, but it should display pop-up warning if there aby speaker which wasn't speaking before.
