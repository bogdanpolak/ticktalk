## Product Name

**Tick-Talk**

---

# 1. Overview

**Tick-Talk** is a lightweight real-time web application that enforces structured, time-boxed speaking during Standup and Grooming meetings.

It enables:

* Equal speaking time
* Clear discussion ownership
* Transparent timing
* Controlled hand-raising for clarifications

Primary goal:
Increase meeting efficiency, fairness, and engagement.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Current meetings:

* Overrun time
* Allow dominant speakers
* Lack structured turn-taking
* Have unclear discussion ownership
* Do not provide objective timing visibility

This leads to:

* Reduced engagement
* Meeting fatigue
* Poor time discipline
* Lower perceived meeting value

---

# 3. Goals & Success Criteria

## Goals

1. Enforce equal speaking time.
2. Increase meeting structure.
3. Improve psychological safety via hand-raise feature.
4. Provide transparent timer visible to all participants.
5. Keep UX friction extremely low.

## Non-Goals (MVP)

* Calendar integrations

* Analytics dashboard
* AI summaries
* Complex authentication

---

# 4. Target Users

## Primary

* Engineering teams (5–12 people)
* Scrum teams
* Product development teams

## Roles

### Host

* Creates session
* Defines slot duration
* Starts meeting
* Selects first speaker

### Participant

* Joins session
* Speaks when active
* Can raise hand
* Can select next speaker when active

---

# 5. Core Features (MVP)

## 5.1 Session Creation

Host:

* Logs in (name only for MVP)
* Sets:

  * Slot duration (e.g., 2 minutes)
* Gets unique join link

---

## 5.2 Lobby

Participants:

* Join via link
* Enter name
* Appear in participant list

Host:

* Sees participants
* Can start meeting

---

## 5.3 Meeting Room

All users see:

* Participant list (includes active speaker indicator)
* Countdown timer (or "Time Expired" indicator + over-time display)
* Hand raise indicators
* Visual indicators showing who has already spoken and total speaking time
* Participant list is placed above the timer in the main column

Host:

* Can select themselves or any participant as first speaker
* Can end meeting at any time (button always enabled)
* "End Meeting" shows warning dialog if unspoken participants remain
* Cannot intervene during active speaker slots (no override)

Active Speaker:

* Sees "End Slot" button
* Can select next speaker from those who haven't spoken yet (if any remain)
* Sees cumulative speaking time for all participants

---

## 5.4 Timer Logic

* Timer duration defined by host.
* When speaker selected:

  * Server sets `slotEndsAt`
  * All clients compute countdown locally.
  * System begins tracking speaker slot start time for duration calculation
* When time expires:

  * Timer shows "⏰ Time Expired" indicator in red
  * Slot remains active - speaker is NOT automatically ended
  * Speaker can continue and must manually end their slot
  * If speaker continues past allocated time, timer switches to over-time display format: "+0:45" (red background, distinct visual state)
  * Speaker then selects next from participants who haven't spoken (if any remain)

Server remains authoritative for slot duration.

---

## 5.5 Speaking Duration Tracking

* Each speaker's actual speaking duration is calculated from when slot begins to when slot ends
* Durations are tracked per session (no multi-round reset)
* Participants who exceed their `slotDurationSeconds` are shown as "Over Time" in the meeting summary
* Total speaking time displayed in Meeting Summary view without overtime highlighting

---

## 5.6 Meeting Summary

When meeting is finished or "End Meeting" is clicked:

* Display list of all participants with:
  * Name
  * Total time spoken (cumulative across the session)
  * Over-time indicator if they exceeded `slotDurationSeconds`
* Host can close summary to return to meeting or fully end session

---

## 5.7 Hand Raise

Inactive participants:

* Can toggle “Raise Hand”
* Visual indicator next to name
* Active speaker may address before continuing

---

# 6. User Flow

## 6.1 Host Flow

Login → Create Session → Share Link → Start Meeting → (Select First Speaker OR Participate as Speaker) → Meeting Cycle → View Summary → End Meeting

Host can:
- Speak during the meeting like any participant
- Select themselves as first speaker
- Monitor speaking times in real-time
- End meeting at any time (with warning if participants haven't spoken)

---

## 6.2 Participant Flow

Open Link → Enter Name → Wait in Lobby → Meeting Starts → Speak When Active → Raise Hand If Needed

---

  slotEndsAt?: DateTime
}
```

## User / Participant

```
Participant {
  id: string
  name: string
  role: 'host' | 'participant'
  isHandRaised: boolean
  totalSpokeDurationSeconds: number     // Cumulative across the session
  speakingHistory: [
    {
      startTime: number,                 // Unix timestamp (ms) when slot started
      endTime?: number,                  // Unix timestamp (ms) when slot ended
      durationSeconds: number            // Calculated duration of this speak
    }
  ]

# 11. Edge Cases

| Case                          | Handling                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Active speaker disconnects    | Host selects next from unspoken participants      |
| Host disconnects              | Promote first participant to host                 |
| Two users select next speaker | Server validates and rejects duplicate            |
| Timer drift                   | Server authoritative `slotEndsAt`                 |
| All participants have spoken  | Prevent next-speaker selection; host ends meeting |
| Speaker exceeds time limit    | Timer shows "+0:MM" over-time format; summary shows overtime indicator |
| Unspoken users on end meeting  | Warning dialog confirms ending with unspoken users |
| Selection of previous speaker | Server validates against `spokenUserIds`, rejects |

# 16. Design Decisions

## Speaker Selection
**Decision:** Single-turn selection with no reset.
* Active speaker can select any participant who has not spoken yet
* Once all participants have spoken, no further selection is allowed
* No ordered queue - maintains flexibility while ensuring fairness

## Host Role as Full Participant
**Decision:** Host is a full participant who can speak during the meeting.
* Host creates the session and can select the first speaker (including themselves)
* Host participates in speaker rotation like any other participant
* Host can end meeting at any time (always-active button) with warning if unspoken users exist
* Once a speaker is active, no host override capability exists during that slot
* Protects speaker autonomy while allowing host to contribute to discussion

## Timer Auto-Advance & Over-Time Display
**Decision:** No auto-advance when timer expires; over-time is visible and tracked.
* Timer shows countdown (MM:SS) until slot time expires
* At expiry: Timer switches to "Time Expired" indicator (red)
* If speaker exceeds allocated time: Timer displays over-time as "+M:SS" (e.g., "+1:12") in distinct visual state
* Speaker slot remains active until speaker manually ends it
* Gives speakers control to finish their thought while making time overages visible to all
* Over-time is indicated in Meeting Summary without special highlight styling

## Meeting Duration
**Decision:** Meetings can exceed total planned duration.
* No enforcement of total meeting duration limits
* Meeting continues until all participants have spoken or host ends meeting
* Prioritizes completion over arbitrary time constraints
