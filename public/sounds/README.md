# Timer Sound File

This directory should contain:
- `timer-expired.mp3` - A short (0.5-1 second) notification sound that plays when the timer expires

## Recommended Sound Characteristics:
- Duration: 0.5–1 second
- Format: MP3 (cross-browser compatibility)
- Type: Single short tone or pleasant chime (e.g., "ding" or bell sound)
- Volume: -20dB normalized (reasonable loudness without being jarring)

## Sources for Sound Files:
- Freesound.org (creative commons)
- Notification sound libraries
- Generated via Audacity or similar tools

For MVP testing, any short notification sound will work. The absence of the file will not break functionality - only the visual indicator will be shown.
